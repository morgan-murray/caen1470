Initial project to read out a Caen N1470 HV NIM Module using C++.

Assumes use of ftd2xx. Recent tarfile included. Compilation assumes that you choose the default naming scheme, that you store the library in /usr/local/lib and that location is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

STATUS: Getters implemented and switchOn function implemented, but not tested. Basic tests for no-device situation written
